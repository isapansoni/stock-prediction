# stock-prediction

trying to predict stock price using machine learning aprroch

Below algorithms are used

1) ridge regressor
2) sgd regressor
3) random forest regressor
4) Deep learning 

ridge regressor is working well on this data set , also hyperparameter tuning for random forest and neural network can help us to achuve better results.
